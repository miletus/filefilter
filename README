PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION

package filefilter
    import "filefilter"

    filefilter uses regular expressions to transform input files to output
    files. This file has command line processing for both flags and
    input/output files. ProcessFlags should be called at the beginning of
    main() in order to process the command line.

    filefilter will process a file (or any io.Reader) by applying regular
    expression based "filters" to the file. A filefilter.Filter has both the
    regular expression and the code to process matches to the regex. The
    ProcessText method takes an data source, breaks it into chunks and
    passes each chunk to applyFilters. applyFilters matches each Filter
    object against the chunk and writes the text from Filter with the
    earliest match.
