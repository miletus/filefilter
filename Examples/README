inex is a command line program that demonstrates the use of the filefilter package. 

Usage:
./inex [flags] [input file] [output file]
If input and/or output files are not given, stdin and stout are used.
-exclude and -include flags are followed by a quoted string with a single regular expression. Use single quotes for the string on the command line.
Multiple -include and -exclude flags are allowed.
If the regular expression is multi-line, use \n to represent a line break in your regular expression string even if the input has a different line break. Set the actual line break that's in the input text with the -newline flag.
You can embed regular expression processing flags in your expression. '(?i)USA' will match with case insensitivity.

Example
./inex -exclude '(?m)^.*aaaa.*\n' -exclude '(?m)^.*bbbb.*\n' input.txt output.txt
will copy all the complete lines of text from input.txt to output.txt except for lines with aaaa or bbbb in them.

Example
The file ImportanceOfBeingEarnest.txt in the Examples directory is the first scene from Oscar Wilde's play "The Importance of Being Earnest". The following line command will give you all the lines that talk about romance. This regular expression uses the fact that in the text all each character's line is separated from the others with two new-lines. Note also that the text uses \r\n for the line separator.
./inex -i='\n(.+\n)*.*roman.*(\n.+)*\n' -newline='\r\n' ImportanceOfBeingEarnest.txt

Suppose I want to see all the lines by the butler, Lane. Of course the easy way to do this would be to use the -include flag, but for the purpose of demonstration this command line excludes everything except for Lane's lines. Like many regular expressions these can be hard to understand. The easiest way to see what each -e flag is doing is to remove it from the command and see what additional text appears in the output. Note that escaping a period or a bracket takes two escape characters -> \\. and \\[ . The program will warn you if you forget the \\ for those and other special characters.
./inex -e='(?m)^(Jack|Algernon|Gwendolen|Lady Bracknell)\\.(.+\n)*' -e='\n\n' -e='(?m)^\\[.*\n(.+\n)*' -e='(?s)^.*Algernon enters\\.\\]\n' -e='(?m)^ACT.*' -newline='\r\n' ImportanceOfBeingEarnest.txt
